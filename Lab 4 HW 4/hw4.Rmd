Be sure to run the `setup` chunk below so that you have the `prop_test()` function available.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(stats250sbi)
```

Recall from section that if you want to use R to run a hypothesis test for $p$, you will use the `prop_test()` function. The arguments needed are 

- `x` the number of successes in the sample
- `n` the sample size
- `p` the hypothesized value for the population proportion
- `alternative` one of `less`, `two.sided`, or `greater` to match the direction in the alternative hypothesis

If you want to use R to calculate a confidence interval for $p$, you will also use the `prop_test()` function. The arguments needed are 

- `x` the number of successes in the sample
- `n` the sample size
- `conf.level` the confidence level as a decimal

**Notes:**

- If you only want to run a hypothesis test, don't include the `conf.level` argument in `prop_test()` (you must include the `p` and `alternative` arguments)
- If you only want to calculate a confidence interval, don't include the `p` and `alternative` arguments (you must include the `conf.level` argument)

You can use the following chunks to use R for your calculations in HW 4. Just be sure to input the arguments and values as appropriate. You can look back to the Lab 4 slides and your Lab 4 notes for examples.
